WinRT XAML Validation===================”WinRT XAML Validation” is a library to enable comprehensive validation of user input in C#/XAML WinRT apps. The implemented validation approach is based on Data Annotations and the <a href="https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CBwQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fmsdn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Flibrary%2Fsystem.componentmodel.dataannotations.validationattribute(v%3Dvs.110).aspx&ei=JbejU-71HMb-8QWy1YHoDg&usg=AFQjCNGDk168Ebqcdc0KYlDcVf3YBDBuyw&sig2=9UHippOZRFo47CUUH8Z8oQ&bvm=bv.69411363,d.dGc">ValidationAttribute</a> class and extends those principles for implicit and explicit synchronous and asynchronous validation of properties and entities as a whole.WinRT XAML Validation is forked from <https://winrtxamlvalidation.codeplex.com/>and ported to portable class libraries (Profile 7). The XAML controls available in the original WinRT XAML Validation library as still present - only the validation attributes, **ValidationBindableBase** class and related classes are moved to a PCL.**Documentation**Please see: <https://winrtxamlvalidation.codeplex.com/documentation>**How portable is this?**(From: http://stackoverflow.com/a/24251137, I've also verified this myself)System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations is supported in certain PCL profiles.Supported profiles:   * .NET 4.0.3 and up    * Windows Store 8 and up    * Silverlight 4 and upMost notably, the latest Windows Phone is not supported (8.1 at the time).See full PCL feature table at: <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg597391%28v=vs.110%29.aspx>However, the part that is more useful might be the XAML control (ValidationPanel and ValidationSummary).
